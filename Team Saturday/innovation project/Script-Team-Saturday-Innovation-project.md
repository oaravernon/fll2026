## Part 1: The Hook – "The 10-Second Destruction" (0:00 – 1:00)

*(The team stands in a line. Ryker is holding an empty spray paint can. Hayden holds a picture of ancient rock art.)*

**Ryker:** *(Shakes the can so it rattles)* Most people think the biggest threat to history is looters stealing gold. But they are wrong. The biggest threat is this. *(Holds up the spray can).*

**Huey:** Looters steal history, but vandals erase it.

**Hayden:** *(Points to the photo)* This is a 2,000-year-old petroglyph. It survived rain, wind, and heat for centuries. But it only took 10 seconds for a vandal to spray their name over it and ruin it forever.

**Ryker:** Hello Judges, we are Team Saturday. Our Innovation Project addresses the problem of "Permanent Erasure"—vandalism at open-air archaeological sites.

**Huey:** Unlike a modern brick wall, you can't just use paint thinner on ancient sandstone. The rock acts like a sponge. If you try to clean it, the chemicals destroy the art underneath.

**Hayden:** There is no "Undo Button" for history. Once it's vandalized, it's gone.

## Part 2: Research & Analysis (1:00 – 2:00)

*(Hayden steps forward with research photos).*

**Hayden:** We researched real-world examples to understand the scope of the problem. We looked at the Roman Colosseum, where tourists are arrested every year for carving names into the stone with keys.

**Ryker:** We also looked at the Altamira Cave in Spain. It wasn't just spray paint—even the breath of tourists caused mold to grow on the paintings!

**Huey:** We realized that current solutions are just Reactive. Security cameras only film the crime happening. By the time the ranger sees the video, the rock is already ruined.

**Ryker:** We needed a solution that is Proactive. We need to stop the vandal before the first drop of paint hits the stone.

## Part 3: The Solution – "Site Guardian" (2:00 – 3:00)

*(Ryker and Huey move to the center).*

**Huey:** Introducing our solution: The Site Guardian.

**Ryker:** The Site Guardian is a hidden, smart security system that uses two layers of protection: Acoustic AI and a Virtual Fence.

**Hayden:** Let's talk about the Acoustic AI. Ryker, you researched sound recognition?

**Ryker:** *(Holds up the Spectrogram/Sound Wave chart)* Exactly. Every sound has a fingerprint. We researched "Spectrograms" and found that the sound of a spray can hissing looks completely different from a bird chirping or wind blowing.

**Huey:** Our system uses a microphone constantly listening for that specific "Hiss" frequency. If it hears a spray can, it triggers an alarm instantly.

**Hayden:** But what if they are using a knife to carve? That's where the Virtual Fence comes in. We use Lidar technology to create an invisible laser curtain 12 inches away from the wall.

**Ryker:** If a hand crosses that invisible line, the system knows a human is too close.

## Part 4: The Prototype (3:00 – 4:00)

*(Hayden moves the LEGO Model to the front).*

**Hayden:** To test this, we built a working prototype using LEGO SPIKE Prime. Here represents our ancient wall.

**Huey:** We programmed an Ultrasonic sensor to act as our "Virtual Fence."

**Hayden:** *(Demonstrating)* If I stand back here at 20 centimeters, the system does nothing. I am just a respectful tourist looking at the art.

**Ryker:** But, if Hayden tries to get too close... *(Hayden moves hand closer than 5cm).*

*[LEGO HUB SOUNDS ALARM / FLASHES RED]*

**Huey:** The system triggers immediately! In the real world, this would do three things:

1. Flash a strobe light to blind the vandal so they can't see to paint.
2. Play a voice warning saying, "Your photo has been sent to the police."
3. Send a silent alert to the Park Ranger station.

## Part 5: Iteration & Feedback (4:00 – 4:30)

*(Ryker steps forward).*

**Ryker:** We didn't get this right on the first try. In our first design, we just had a motion sensor. But we realized that wild animals, like deer or birds, would set off the alarm all night long.

**Hayden:** That's why we iterated and added the Acoustic AI concept. By combining sound and distance, we filter out false alarms. A deer doesn't sound like a spray can!

**Huey:** We shared our idea with [Insert Name of Teacher/Adult you talked to]. They liked the "Active Deterrent" idea because most vandals act out of boredom. If a bright light flashes, they get scared and run away before doing damage.

## Part 6: Conclusion (4:30 – 5:00)

**Ryker:** To summarize: Vandalism is fast, cheap, and permanent.

**Hayden:** The Site Guardian uses smart technology to create an invisible shield around our history.

**Huey:** It detects the specific sounds and movements of vandals to stop them in their tracks.

**Ryker:** With the Site Guardian...

**All Team:** We don't just watch history happen; we keep history safe.

**Hayden:** Thank you! We are now ready to answer your questions.

## Specific Notes for the Boys:

**Ryker:** You are the "Sound Expert." When you talk about the Spectrogram, trace the imaginary line of the wave in the air with your finger. It makes you look like a scientist.

**Huey:** You are the "Problem Solver." When you talk about the solution being Proactive, emphasize that word clearly. It's a big vocabulary word judges like.

**Hayden:** You are the "Engineer." Make sure the LEGO model actually works during the demo! If it fails, just explain what should have happened confidently.

**The "Hiss" Sound:** In Part 3, when Ryker mentions the hiss, he should actually make a "PSSSHHH" sound to emphasize the point.
