## AI Usage Questions

### Q1: Have you used AI for research or your slides? How did you use it?

**Sample Answer:**

Yes, we used AI tools as helpful assistants throughout our project, but we always did the real thinking and work ourselves. Here's how:

**For Research:**
- We used AI to help us find information about vandalism at archaeological sites
- We asked AI to explain complex concepts like "spectrograms" and "acoustic recognition" in simpler terms
- We used it to help locate research papers and articles about site protection
- We used AI to help us understand technical terms we encountered

**For Our Presentation:**
- We used AI to help organize our ideas into clear outlines
- We used it to check our grammar and improve clarity
- We used AI image generators to create concept diagrams showing how Site Guardian works
- We used it to help us think about different ways to explain our ideas

**Important:** We always verified AI information by checking multiple sources. We made sure we understood everything ourselves and could explain it in our own words. AI was a tool to help us learn, not to do our work for us.

**What We Learned:** AI helped us access information faster and understand complex topics, but we still had to do the real work of understanding the problem, designing our solution, building our prototype, and creating our presentation ourselves.

---

### Q2: Did AI write your presentation for you?

**Sample Answer:**

No, absolutely not. We wrote every word of our presentation ourselves. Here's what we did:

- **We wrote all content:** Every sentence came from our own understanding and research
- **We used AI as a helper:** Like using a dictionary or asking a teacher for clarification
- **We made all decisions:** We decided what to include, how to explain things, and what our key points would be
- **We practiced together:** We practiced our presentation many times and refined it based on what worked

AI was a tool, like using Google to search or using spell-check. It helped us, but we did all the thinking, writing, and presenting ourselves. Our presentation reflects our own understanding and our team's unique approach to the problem.

## Project Origin Questions

### Q3: How did you come up with this idea?

**Sample Answer:**

Our idea came from a combination of research, real-world examples, and creative problem-solving. Here's our journey:

**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**
- We started by researching archaeological sites and learned about vandalism
- We discovered that vandalism causes permanent damage that can't be undone
- We learned about real examples: Roman Colosseum, Altamira Cave, Horseshoe Canyon
- We realized that current solutions (cameras) only record the crime after it happens

**Step 2: The "Aha!" Moment**
- We realized that vandalism happens in seconds - a spray can can ruin thousands of years of history in 10 seconds
- We thought: "What if we could stop vandals BEFORE they damage anything?"
- This led us to the idea of proactive prevention instead of reactive monitoring

**Step 3: Researching Technology**
- Ryker researched sound recognition and spectrograms
- We learned that different sounds have unique "fingerprints"
- We discovered that spray cans make a distinctive "hiss" sound
- We researched Lidar technology for creating virtual boundaries

**Step 4: Combining Ideas**
- We combined acoustic AI (sound recognition) with virtual fence (distance detection)
- We added active deterrents (lights, voice warnings) to scare vandals away
- We created a multi-layered system that's more effective than any single solution

**Step 5: Building and Testing**
- We built our LEGO prototype to test the virtual fence concept
- We learned from testing and improved our design
- We got feedback from experts and other teams

**Key Point:** Our idea came from recognizing that prevention is better than reaction, and combining multiple technologies to create an effective solution!

---

### Q4: What inspired you to work on vandalism prevention?

**Sample Answer:**

We were inspired by learning about the permanent destruction of history. When we researched archaeological sites, we discovered:

- **The Permanence:** Once vandalized, many sites can never be fully restored
- **The Speed:** Vandalism happens in seconds, but the damage lasts forever
- **The Loss:** We're losing irreplaceable history to spray paint and carvings
- **The Need:** Current solutions don't prevent the damage - they only record it

We thought: "This is wrong. History belongs to everyone, and we need to protect it." That's what inspired us. We wanted to use technology to stop vandals before they can cause damage, not just watch them do it.

We were also inspired by learning that most vandals act impulsively - if we can interrupt them, they often flee. Our Site Guardian does exactly that - it detects the threat and scares them away before damage occurs.

## Technical and Design Questions

### Q15: How does your Site Guardian actually work?

**Sample Answer:**

Site Guardian works through a multi-layered detection and deterrent system:

**Layer 1: Acoustic AI (Sound Recognition)**
- Microphones constantly listen for specific sounds
- The system is trained to recognize the "hiss" of a spray can or the "clink" of tools hitting stone
- Every sound has a unique "fingerprint" called a spectrogram
- When the system hears a vandalism sound, it triggers an alert

**Layer 2: Virtual Fence (Distance Detection)**
- Lidar technology creates an invisible laser boundary 12 inches away from the protected surface
- If a hand or object crosses this boundary, the system detects it
- This catches vandals using tools (like knives) that don't make distinctive sounds
- The combination of sound + distance reduces false alarms

**Layer 3: Active Deterrents**
- When a threat is detected, three things happen immediately:
  1. **Strobe Lights:** Bright flashing lights blind the vandal so they can't see to paint or carve
  2. **Voice Warning:** A speaker says "Warning: You are in a protected heritage zone. Your photo has been sent to the Ranger station."
  3. **Silent Alert:** A message is sent to the Park Ranger station with location and time

**Our LEGO Prototype:**
- We use an ultrasonic sensor as our "virtual fence"
- When something gets closer than 5cm, the system triggers
- The Hub flashes red lights and plays a warning sound
- This demonstrates the concept of distance-based detection

**Key Innovation:** By combining multiple detection methods and active deterrents, we stop vandals before they can cause damage, not just record them doing it!

---

### Q16: How do you prevent false alarms from wildlife or natural sounds?

**Sample Answer:**

This was a key challenge we addressed through our multi-layered system:

**The Problem:**
- Our first design used only motion sensors, which would go off constantly from birds, deer, wind, etc.
- We needed a way to distinguish between threats and normal activity

**Our Solution - Multi-Layer Detection:**
- **Acoustic AI:** Trained to recognize specific vandalism sounds (spray can hiss, tool sounds), not natural sounds
- **Virtual Fence:** Only triggers if something crosses the boundary AND stays there (vandals pause to vandalize, animals keep moving)
- **Combination Logic:** Both systems must detect a threat, reducing false alarms significantly

**Environmental Considerations:**
- We researched how to filter out wind, rain, and natural sounds
- The system can be calibrated for different environments
- Machine learning allows the system to improve over time, learning what's normal for each site

**Our Iteration:**
- When we realized false alarms would be a problem, we didn't give up
- We researched solutions and found that combining detection methods is more effective
- This iteration improved our design significantly

**Key Point:** The combination of sound recognition + distance detection + environmental filtering makes our system smart enough to distinguish real threats from normal activity!

---

## Iteration and Improvement Questions

### Q17: How did you improve your design after testing?

**Sample Answer:**

We improved our design through multiple iterations based on testing and feedback:

**First Design Problems:**
- We started with just motion sensors
- This would trigger constantly from wildlife, wind, and normal activity
- We realized this wouldn't work in real-world conditions

**How We Improved:**
- We added acoustic AI to recognize specific vandalism sounds
- We combined it with distance detection (virtual fence) to create multi-layer detection
- We tested the combination and found it much more effective

**Second Round of Improvements:**
- After expert feedback, we added consideration of environmental factors
- We researched how to handle wind, rain, and natural sounds
- We improved our documentation to include these considerations

**Third Round:**
- After sharing with Lake Country teams, we thought more about cost and maintenance
- We considered how the system could integrate with existing security
- We added the educational component to voice warnings

**What We Learned:**
- Failure is how you learn - our first design's problems taught us what we needed
- Combining technologies is more effective than single solutions
- Getting feedback from others helps you see things you missed
- Iteration is essential - no design is perfect the first time

**Current Design:**
- Our multi-layered system is much more effective
- It addresses the false alarm problem
- It's more practical for real-world implementation
- It demonstrates that we understand iteration and improvement

**Key Lesson:** Every iteration made our design better. We learned that good design comes from testing, getting feedback, and being willing to change and improve!

---

### Q18: What was your biggest challenge and how did you overcome it?

**Sample Answer:**

Our biggest challenge was preventing false alarms while still detecting real threats. Here's how we overcame it:

**The Challenge:**
- We needed to detect vandals accurately
- But we couldn't have the system going off constantly from normal activity
- Single detection methods weren't reliable enough

**How We Overcame It:**
1. **Research:** We researched how real security systems handle this problem
2. **Brainstorming:** We brainstormed ways to combine detection methods
3. **Testing:** We tested different approaches with our LEGO prototype
4. **Expert Consultation:** We got feedback from the archaeology professor
5. **Iteration:** We kept improving until we found a solution that worked

**The Solution:**
- We combined acoustic AI (sound recognition) with virtual fence (distance detection)
- Both systems must detect a threat, reducing false alarms
- We added logic to filter out normal environmental sounds
- We designed the system to learn what's normal for each site

**What We Learned:**
- Complex problems require creative solutions
- Combining technologies is often more effective than single solutions
- Getting expert feedback helps you see problems you might miss
- Persistence and iteration are essential

**Key Takeaway:** Overcoming this challenge taught us that good engineering is about solving real problems through research, creativity, and persistence!
