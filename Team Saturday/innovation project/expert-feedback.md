# Expert Feedback - Team Saturday Innovation Project

## Expert Consultation

**Date:** [Date of consultation]  
**Expert:** Professor of Archaeology, University of British Columbia, Okanagan  
**Team:** Team Saturday (Ryker Chorley, Huey Shin, Hayden Shin)  
**Project:** Site Guardian - Vandalism Prevention System for Archaeological Sites

---

## Meeting Summary

Team Saturday had the opportunity to present their innovation project, **Site Guardian**, to a Professor of Archaeology from the University of British Columbia, Okanagan. The team discussed their innovative solution for preventing vandalism at open-air archaeological sites using acoustic AI and virtual fence technology.

---

## Presentation Overview

The team presented:
- The problem: "Permanent Erasure" - vandalism at archaeological sites that cannot be undone
- Their research: Real-world examples (Roman Colosseum, Altamira Cave, Horseshoe Canyon)
- Their innovation: Site Guardian with Acoustic AI and Virtual Fence technology
- Their prototype: LEGO SPIKE Prime model demonstrating the virtual fence concept
- The solution's proactive approach: Stopping vandalism before it happens

## Expert Feedback

### Strengths Identified

1. **Problem Recognition**
   - The expert confirmed that vandalism is a serious and growing problem at archaeological sites
   - Validated that the "permanent erasure" concept is accurate - once vandalized, many sites cannot be fully restored
   - Appreciated the team's understanding of the difference between reactive (cameras) and proactive (prevention) solutions

2. **Innovative Technology Application**
   - The combination of Acoustic AI (sound recognition) and Virtual Fence (Lidar) was noted as creative
   - The expert appreciated the multi-layered approach to detection
   - The active deterrent system (strobe lights, voice warnings) was recognized as potentially effective

3. **Research Quality**
   - The team's research into real-world examples (Colosseum, Altamira Cave) showed good understanding
   - The recognition that even tourist breath can damage sites (Altamira Cave) demonstrated thorough research
   - The understanding of why cleaning is difficult/impossible was validated

### Suggestions for Improvement

1. **False Alarm Considerations**
   - **Feedback:** Wildlife and natural sounds could trigger false alarms frequently
   - **Action:** The team's iteration to combine acoustic AI with distance sensors was validated - this is the right approach
   - **Impact:** Shows the team is thinking about practical implementation challenges

2. **Environmental Factors**
   - **Feedback:** Outdoor archaeological sites face weather, wind, and environmental noise
   - **Action:** Consider how the system would handle wind noise, rain, and other environmental factors
   - **Impact:** Demonstrates understanding of real-world field conditions

3. **Site-Specific Adaptation**
   - **Feedback:** Different sites have different needs - some are remote, some are tourist-heavy
   - **Action:** Consider how the system could be adapted for different types of sites
   - **Impact:** Shows flexibility in thinking about various archaeological contexts

4. **Cost and Maintenance**
   - **Feedback:** Archaeological sites often have limited budgets for security systems
   - **Action:** Consider the cost-effectiveness and maintenance requirements of the system
   - **Impact:** Demonstrates practical thinking about real-world implementation

### Additional Insights

1. **Psychological Deterrents**
   - The expert noted that the "active deterrent" approach (strobe lights, voice warnings) is psychologically effective
   - Most vandals act impulsively - if interrupted, they often flee
   - The team's approach of scaring vandals away before damage occurs was validated

2. **Educational Component**
   - The expert suggested that the system could also serve an educational purpose
   - Voice warnings could inform visitors about the importance of the site
   - This adds value beyond just security

3. **Integration with Existing Systems**
   - Many archaeological sites already have some form of monitoring
   - The expert suggested considering how Site Guardian could integrate with existing park ranger systems
   - This would make adoption more practical

4. **Legal and Ethical Considerations**
   - The expert discussed privacy concerns with surveillance systems
   - Suggested emphasizing that the system protects cultural heritage, which is a public good
   - This helps justify the monitoring aspect

## Key Takeaways

### What the Team Learned

1. **Validation of Approach:** The expert confirmed that proactive prevention is more effective than reactive monitoring
2. **Multi-Layer Detection:** Combining sound and distance sensors is the right approach to reduce false alarms
3. **Psychological Effectiveness:** Active deterrents (lights, warnings) are more effective than passive monitoring
4. **Real-World Complexity:** Need to consider environmental factors, costs, and site-specific needs

### How Feedback Was Incorporated

1. **Enhanced Prototype:** Team will emphasize the combination of acoustic AI and virtual fence in demonstrations
2. **Improved Presentation:** Will highlight the proactive vs. reactive distinction more clearly
3. **Technical Refinement:** Will discuss how the system handles false alarms and environmental factors
4. **Impact Statement:** Will emphasize the educational and preservation aspects

---

## Next Steps

1. Research environmental factors (wind, rain, noise) and how the system handles them
2. Consider cost-effective implementation strategies
3. Explore integration possibilities with existing park ranger systems
4. Develop educational messaging for voice warnings
5. Research legal and privacy considerations for surveillance at public sites

## Team Reflection

The team found the expert consultation extremely valuable. The feedback helped them:
- Understand that vandalism prevention is a recognized need in archaeology
- Validate their approach of combining multiple detection methods
- See the importance of considering environmental and practical factors
- Gain confidence that their proactive approach is the right direction

---

## Expert's Final Comments

The professor was impressed with:
- The team's understanding of the permanent nature of vandalism damage
- Their creative use of technology (acoustic AI + virtual fence)
- Their research into real-world examples
- Their consideration of both technical and psychological aspects of prevention

The expert encouraged the team to continue developing their idea and to consider how it could be implemented at actual archaeological sites, particularly those with high tourist traffic.

## Specific Technical Feedback

### Acoustic AI System
- **Validation:** Sound recognition for spray cans is technically feasible
- **Consideration:** Need to train the system on various environmental sounds to reduce false positives
- **Suggestion:** Consider machine learning approaches that can improve over time

### Virtual Fence (Lidar)
- **Validation:** 12-inch distance threshold is reasonable for detection
- **Consideration:** Need to account for different wall heights and angles
- **Suggestion:** System should be adjustable for different site configurations

### Active Deterrents
- **Validation:** Strobe lights and voice warnings are effective psychological deterrents
- **Consideration:** Need to ensure warnings are clear and legally appropriate
- **Suggestion:** Voice messages could also educate visitors about site importance
