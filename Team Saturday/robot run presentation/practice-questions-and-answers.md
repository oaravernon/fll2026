## Robot Design Questions

### Q1: Tell me about your robot design. Why did you choose this design?

**Sample Answer:**

Our robot is designed to be reliable, efficient, and able to complete our chosen missions consistently. Here's our design approach:

**Mission-Focused Design:**
- We designed our robot specifically for our chosen missions: M01 (Surface Brushing), M05_06_08 (Silo), and M12 (Salvage Operation)
- Each part of our robot serves a purpose for these specific missions
- We prioritized reliability over complexity

**Stability and Control:**
- Our base is designed for stability and precise movement
- We use sensors for accurate navigation and positioning
- Our wheels and motors are chosen for the right balance of speed and control

**Why This Design:**
- We tested different designs and found this one works best for our missions
- It's reliable - it does the same thing every time we run it
- It's efficient - we can complete our missions quickly
- It's maintainable - we can fix problems quickly if they arise

**Key Point:** Our design focuses on doing our chosen missions really well, rather than trying to do everything!

### Q2: How did you decide which missions to attempt?

**Sample Answer:**

We chose our missions based on strategic thinking and testing:

**Point Value Analysis:**
- We calculated which missions give us the best points for time invested
- We balanced high-point missions with reliable, consistent missions
- We prioritized missions we could complete consistently

**Reliability Testing:**
- We tested each potential mission many times
- We only chose missions we could complete at least 90% of the time
- We avoided missions that were too risky or unreliable

**Robot Capabilities:**
- We matched missions to what our robot can do well
- We designed our robot and attachments for our chosen missions
- We made sure our robot can reach and interact with the mission models effectively

**Our Mission Set:**
- **M01:** Surface Brushing - reliable and consistent
- **M05_06_08:** Silo - good points and achievable
- **M12:** Salvage Operation - challenging but worth the points

**Key Point:** We didn't try to do everything - we focused on doing our chosen missions really well!
