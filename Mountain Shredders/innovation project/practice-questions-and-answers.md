## AI Usage Questions

### Q1: Have you used AI for research or your slides? How did you use it?

**Sample Answer:**

Yes, we did use AI tools to help with our research and presentation, but we used them as tools to help us learn, not to do the work for us. Here's how we used AI:

**For Research:**
- We used AI to help us find information about archaeological challenges
- We asked AI to explain complex concepts in simpler terms so we could understand the science
- We used it to help us find research papers and articles related to our project
- We used AI to help us understand technical terms we encountered

**For Our Presentation:**
- We used AI to help us organize our ideas and create outlines for our slides
- We used it to check our grammar and make sure our explanations were clear
- We used AI image generators to create some concept diagrams
- We used it to help us think about different ways to explain our ideas

**Important:** We always verified the information AI gave us by checking multiple sources, and we made sure we understood everything ourselves. We didn't just copy what AI said - we used it as a starting point to learn more, then we did our own research to confirm the facts.

**What We Learned:** AI helped us understand complex topics faster, but we still had to do the real work of understanding the problem, designing our solution, and building our prototype ourselves.

---

### Q2: Did AI write your presentation for you?

**Sample Answer:**

No, AI did not write our presentation. We wrote it ourselves. Here's what we did:

- **We wrote all the content:** Every word in our presentation came from our own understanding and research
- **We used AI as a helper:** Like a dictionary or encyclopedia - to look up information and check our work
- **We made all the decisions:** We decided what to include, how to explain things, and what our key points would be
- **We practiced together:** We practiced our presentation many times and made changes based on what worked best for our team

AI was a tool, like using Google to search for information or using spell-check. It helped us, but we did the thinking, writing, and presenting ourselves.

## Project Origin Questions

### Q3: How did you come up with this idea?

**Sample Answer:**

Our idea came from a combination of research, brainstorming, and real-world problems we learned about. Here's our process:

**Step 1: Understanding the Theme**
- We started by learning about archaeology and the UNEARTHED theme
- We watched videos about archaeological excavations and read about challenges archaeologists face
- We explored different problems in archaeology

**Step 2: Identifying the Problem**
- We researched various archaeological challenges
- We learned about specific problems archaeologists encounter
- We identified a problem that interested our team

**Step 3: Researching Existing Solutions**
- We researched what already exists to solve this problem
- We found that existing solutions have limitations
- This gap gave us our opportunity

**Step 4: Brainstorming Together**
- We had team meetings where we all shared ideas
- We combined our individual ideas
- We worked together to develop our solution

**Step 5: Building and Testing**
- We built our prototype to test if our idea would work
- We learned from failures and improved our design
- We got feedback from experts and other teams

**Key Point:** Our idea didn't come from one person - it came from our whole team working together, doing research, and building on each other's ideas.

### Q4: What inspired you to work on this problem?

**Sample Answer:**

We were inspired by learning about real archaeologists and the challenges they face. When we researched archaeology, we learned that:

- Archaeologists face real problems in their work
- Many challenges don't have good solutions yet
- Technology can help solve these problems
- Young people can contribute to important fields like archaeology

We thought: "What if we could help archaeologists do their work better?" That's what inspired us. We wanted to use technology to solve a real problem that affects real people and helps preserve history.

We also got inspired when we learned about the UNEARTHED theme and realized that archaeology isn't just about digging - it's about uncovering stories and preserving our past for future generations.
