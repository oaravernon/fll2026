## Part 1: The Skit – "The Unreachable Tomb" (0:00 – 1:00)

*(The team stands in a line. Nelson is kneeling on the floor looking at a "crack" in the ground. Luke is holding a "DANGER: UNSTABLE TUNNEL" sign.)*

**Nelson (The Archaeologist):** *(Excited)* Guys! Come look at this! My ground-penetrating radar just picked up something massive. I think it's a hidden chamber right under this city!

**Luke (Safety Officer):** *(Steps in front with the sign)* Whoa, stop right there, Nelson! Look at this tunnel. It's winding, it's only one foot wide, and the ceiling is cracking. If a human crawls in there, the whole thing collapses!

**Nelson:** But there are artifacts in there! Ancient pottery! History! We can't just leave it.

**Silas (The Engineer):** What about using a bulldozer or a backhoe?

**Luke:** No way. A rigid machine acts like a bull in a china shop. It would crush the artifacts instantly. Plus, big machines can't bend around corners.

**Silas:** So, we have a problem. We need to reach a fragile object, through a dangerous, winding tunnel, without sending a human inside or using heavy machinery that destroys the ground.

**Luke:** Sounds like we need a robot. But not just any robot.

**All Team:** We need the Flexi-Digger!

## Part 2: Research & Analysis (1:00 – 2:00)

*(Team drops the "acting" voices and speaks directly to the judges).*

**Luke:** Hello Judges, we are the Excavators from OARA Youth Innovation Lab. Our Innovation Project addresses the dangers of archaeological excavation in tight, unstable spaces.

**Nelson:** Before designing our solution, we researched what technology already exists. We looked at "Snake Robots" used by universities like Carnegie Mellon.

**Silas:** While snake robots can wiggle into caves, we found a major limitation: they are usually just cameras. They are inspection tools, not workers. They aren't strong enough to actually dig.

**Luke:** We also looked at "Vine Robots" from the field of Soft Robotics, which grow like plants. But these are made of soft plastic; they can't move heavy dirt or rocks.

**Nelson:** We realized archaeologists needed something in the middle. Something flexible like a snake, but strong enough to excavate like a machine.

## Part 3: The Solution – "How It Works" (2:00 – 3:00)

*(Silas and Nelson move the LEGO Model to the front).*

**Silas:** Meet the Flexi-Digger. It is a Cable-Driven Articulated Arm.

**Nelson:** Unlike a stiff bulldozer, our robot is made of "vertebrae," just like a human backbone. This allows it to bend into S-shapes to slither around fallen rocks in a tunnel. *(Silas bends the model into an S-shape).*

**Silas:** One of our biggest innovations is where we put the motors. In most robots, the motors are in the arm, making it heavy and bulky. In the Flexi-Digger, the heavy motors and batteries stay outside the cave with the operator.

**Luke:** We use thin steel cables—like bicycle brake cables—running through the spine to pull and bend the arm. This keeps the arm lightweight and safe.

**Nelson:** But how do we dig without breaking the vase? We invented a concept called "Granular Fluidization." Instead of a metal claw, the tip of our robot uses a "soft-air" jet.

**Luke:** It blows a gentle stream of air to loosen the dirt, making it act like a liquid, and then a vacuum hose sucks the dirt away. It reveals the artifact without ever scratching it.

## Part 4: The Prototype & Iteration (3:00 – 4:00)

*(This section covers the "Model" and "Iterate" rubric points).*

**Silas:** To prove this concept, we built this LEGO prototype using a Tension Spine mechanism.

**Luke:** *(Demonstrating)* We used flexible ribbed tubing for the spine and threaded string through these beam "vertebrae." When we turn this crank, it pulls the "tendon," causing the arm to curl.

**Nelson:** But it didn't work perfectly the first time. In our first design, the arm was too floppy. When we tried to curl it, it just buckled sideways.

**Silas:** *[ITERATION POINT]* We iterated on our design by adding specific spacers between the vertebrae to create tension. Now, when we pull the string, it curls precisely where we want it to.

## Part 5: Sharing & Impact (4:00 – 4:45)

*(This section covers the "Communicate" rubric point).*

**Luke:** We didn't keep this idea to ourselves. We shared our design with friends, our coaches, parents.

**Nelson:** They gave us great feedback. They suggested that in the real world, we would need to make sure the air pressure wasn't too high, or we might blast the artifact away!

**Silas:** Based on that feedback, we added a "pressure regulator" concept to our design documentation to keep the airflow gentle and controlled.

**Luke:** We believe the Flexi-Digger isn't just for archaeologists. It could also be used for Search and Rescue in collapsed buildings after an earthquake.

## Part 6: Conclusion (4:45 – 5:00)

**Luke:** To summarize: Traditional digging is dangerous for humans and bad for history.

**Silas:** The Flexi-Digger solves this with a cable-driven, articulated arm.

**Nelson:** It keeps the operator safe and uses air to gently uncover treasures. With the Flexi-Digger...

**All Team:** We don't just dig the past; we protect it for the future!

**Nelson:** Thank you! We are now ready for your questions.

## 💡 Tips for the OARA Team

### The "Safety" Role

Since Luke took over the "Safety Officer" lines in the skit, he should hold the "DANGER" sign very clearly so the judges see the "problem" immediately.

### The Hand-Off

When Silas is talking about the motors at the base, Nelson should be the one physically pointing to the parts on the LEGO model so Silas can focus on speaking.

### The Feedback Blank

In Part 5, make sure to actually say the name of someone you showed the project to. If you haven't yet, show it to your coach or a teacher today!

### Practice the "S" Bend

Make sure Silas can bend the LEGO model into that "S" shape quickly while Nelson is talking about the "vertebrae." It's a great visual for the judges.
