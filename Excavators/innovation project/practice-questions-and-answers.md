## AI Usage Questions

### Q1: Have you used AI for research or your slides? How did you use it?

**Sample Answer:**

Yes, we did use AI tools to help with our research, but we used them as tools to help us learn, not to do the work for us. Here's how we used AI:

**For Research:**
- We used AI to help us find information about existing robots like snake robots and vine robots
- We asked AI to explain complex concepts like "granular fluidization" in simpler terms so we could understand the science
- We used it to help us find research papers and articles about archaeological excavation challenges

**For Our Presentation:**
- We used AI to help us organize our ideas and create outlines for our slides
- We used it to check our grammar and make sure our explanations were clear
- We used AI image generators to create some concept diagrams showing how our Flexi-Digger would work

**Important:** We always verified the information AI gave us by checking multiple sources, and we made sure we understood everything ourselves. We didn't just copy what AI said - we used it as a starting point to learn more, then we did our own research to confirm the facts.

**What We Learned:** AI helped us understand complex topics faster, but we still had to do the real work of understanding the problem, designing our solution, and building our prototype ourselves.

---

### Q2: Did AI write your presentation for you?

**Sample Answer:**

No, AI did not write our presentation. We wrote it ourselves. Here's what we did:

- **We wrote all the content:** Every word in our presentation came from our own understanding and research
- **We used AI as a helper:** Like a dictionary or encyclopedia - to look up information and check our work
- **We made all the decisions:** We decided what to include, how to explain things, and what our key points would be
- **We practiced together:** We practiced our presentation many times and made changes based on what worked best for our team

AI was a tool, like using Google to search for information or using spell-check. It helped us, but we did the thinking, writing, and presenting ourselves.

## Project Origin Questions

### Q3: How did you come up with this idea?

**Sample Answer:**

Our idea came from a combination of research, brainstorming, and real-world problems we learned about. Here's our process:

**Step 1: Understanding the Theme**
- We started by learning about archaeology and the UNEARTHED theme
- We watched videos about archaeological excavations and read about the challenges archaeologists face
- We learned that many artifacts are found in dangerous, tight spaces

**Step 2: Identifying the Problem**
- We discovered that traditional excavation tools are rigid and can't bend around corners
- We learned that archaeologists often have to crawl into dangerous caves and tunnels
- We found out that big machines can crush fragile artifacts

**Step 3: Researching Existing Solutions**
- We researched what already exists: snake robots (for inspection) and vine robots (too soft)
- We found that nothing exists that is both flexible AND strong enough to excavate
- This gap gave us our opportunity

**Step 4: Brainstorming Together**
- We had team meetings where we all shared ideas
- Nelson suggested the vertebrae design after learning about how snake robots work
- Silas came up with the cable-driven concept to keep motors outside dangerous spaces
- Luke researched granular fluidization for gentle artifact uncovering
- We combined all our ideas to create the Flexi-Digger

**Step 5: Building and Testing**
- We built our LEGO prototype to test if our idea would work
- We learned from failures and improved our design
- We got feedback from experts and other teams

**Key Point:** Our idea didn't come from one person - it came from our whole team working together, doing research, and building on each other's ideas.

---

### Q4: What inspired you to work on this problem?

**Sample Answer:**

We were inspired by learning about real archaeologists and the dangers they face. When we watched videos and read articles about archaeological excavations, we learned that:

- Archaeologists risk their lives crawling into unstable caves and tunnels
- Many artifacts are lost or damaged because current tools can't reach them safely
- History is being destroyed because we can't access it safely

We thought: "What if we could help archaeologists do their work safely while protecting artifacts?" That's what inspired us. We wanted to use technology to solve a real problem that affects real people and helps preserve history.

We also got inspired when we learned about the UNEARTHED theme and realized that archaeology isn't just about digging - it's about uncovering stories and preserving our past for future generations.

## Technical and Design Questions

### Q15: How does your Flexi-Digger actually work?

**Sample Answer:**

The Flexi-Digger works through a combination of innovative design features:

**The Cable-Driven System:**
- Heavy motors and batteries stay outside the dangerous cave with the operator
- Only the lightweight arm goes inside
- Thin steel cables (like bicycle brake cables) run from the motors through the arm
- When the motors pull the cables, they bend the arm

**The Vertebrae Design:**
- Instead of one rigid stick, the arm is made of many small segments (like a backbone)
- Each segment can move independently
- This allows the arm to bend into S-shapes to get around obstacles
- The segments are connected by flexible joints

**The Soft Excavation System:**
- Instead of a hard metal claw, the tip uses "granular fluidization"
- A gentle air jet loosens the dirt, making it act like a liquid
- A soft vacuum hose then removes the dirt
- This reveals artifacts without scratching or crushing them

**Our LEGO Prototype:**
- We used flexible ribbed tubing as the spine
- Technic beams act as vertebrae
- A string acts as the tendon
- When we pull the string, the arm curls like a finger

**Key Innovation:** By keeping the heavy parts outside and using cables to control a lightweight flexible arm, we can reach places that rigid machines can't, while keeping operators safe!

---

### Q16: Why did you choose this design over other options?

**Sample Answer:**

We considered several options and chose this design for specific reasons:

**Option 1: Rigid Arm (Rejected)**
- **Why we didn't choose it:** Can't bend around corners, which defeats the purpose
- **Our solution:** Flexible vertebrae design

**Option 2: Snake Robot (Existing Technology)**
- **Why we didn't just copy it:** Snake robots are only for inspection, not strong enough to dig
- **Our solution:** We made ours strong enough to excavate while staying flexible

**Option 3: Motors Inside the Arm (Rejected)**
- **Why we didn't choose it:** Would make the arm too heavy and bulky
- **Our solution:** Cable-driven system keeps motors outside

**Option 4: Hard Claw (Rejected)**
- **Why we didn't choose it:** Would break fragile artifacts
- **Our solution:** Granular fluidization for gentle excavation

**Why Our Design is Best:**
- It's flexible enough to reach tight spaces
- It's strong enough to actually excavate
- It's lightweight because motors stay outside
- It's gentle enough to preserve artifacts
- It keeps operators safe

**Decision Process:** We tested different ideas, researched what exists, and combined the best features into our unique solution!

---

## Iteration and Improvement Questions

### Q17: How did you improve your design after testing?

**Sample Answer:**

We improved our design through multiple iterations based on testing and feedback:

**First Prototype Problems:**
- The arm was too floppy and buckled sideways when we tried to curl it
- It didn't have enough tension to control the bending
- The vertebrae were too far apart

**How We Fixed It:**
- We added spacers between the vertebrae to create better tension
- We adjusted the spacing to find the right balance between flexibility and control
- We tested different string tensions until we found what worked

**Second Round of Improvements:**
- After getting feedback about air pressure, we added a pressure regulator concept
- We researched pressure thresholds to protect fragile artifacts
- We improved our documentation to include these safety features

**What We Learned:**
- Failure is how you learn - our first "failure" taught us what we needed to fix
- Small changes can make big differences
- Testing is essential - you can't know if something works until you try it

**Current Design:**
- Our prototype now curls precisely where we want it to
- It demonstrates the concept effectively
- It shows judges that we understand iteration and improvement

**Key Lesson:** Every iteration made our design better. We didn't give up when things didn't work - we learned from it and improved!

---

### Q18: What was your biggest challenge and how did you overcome it?

**Sample Answer:**

Our biggest challenge was making the arm flexible enough to bend, but strong enough to actually work. Here's how we overcame it:

**The Challenge:**
- We needed flexibility to bend around corners
- But we also needed strength and control
- Our first attempts were either too floppy or too rigid

**How We Overcame It:**
1. **Research:** We researched how real flexible robots work
2. **Experimentation:** We tried many different designs with LEGO
3. **Testing:** We tested each version to see what worked
4. **Iteration:** We kept improving based on what we learned
5. **Teamwork:** We worked together to solve the problem

**The Solution:**
- We found the right balance of vertebrae spacing
- We used the right tension in our cable system
- We combined flexibility with structural support

**What We Learned:**
- Complex problems require multiple attempts
- Teamwork helps you see solutions you might miss alone
- Persistence pays off - we didn't give up!

**Key Takeaway:** Overcoming this challenge taught us that engineering is about solving problems through research, testing, and not giving up!
