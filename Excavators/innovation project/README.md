## 🎨 Creating Your Final Presentation Slides

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### **Slide 1: Title Slide**
**What to include:**
- Team name: "The Excavators"
- Project name: "Flexi-Digger"
- Tagline: "A Flexible Robotic Arm for Archaeological Excavation"
- Team members: Nelson, Silas, Luke
- Theme: "FLL Challenge 2026 - Unearthed"

**Design tip:** Use images of archaeology or your LEGO model

---

#### **Slide 2: The Problem (IDENTIFY Phase)**
**What to include:**
- **The Challenge:** Archaeologists need to excavate artifacts in dangerous, tight spaces
- **Why it's dangerous:**
  - Narrow tunnels (only 1 foot wide)
  - Unstable ceilings (risk of collapse)
  - Toxic dust (like in Egyptian tombs)
  - Lack of oxygen
- **Why current tools fail:**
  - Rigid machines can't bend around corners
  - Big machines crush fragile artifacts
  - Humans shouldn't enter dangerous spaces

**Visuals to add:**
- Picture of a narrow cave/tunnel
- Diagram showing the problem
- Your "DANGER: UNSTABLE TUNNEL" sign

**What to say:** "Traditional excavation tools are rigid and straight. They cannot bend around corners. Archaeologists face risks of rockfall, lack of oxygen, or inhaling toxic dust."

---

#### **Slide 3: Research - What Already Exists (RESEARCH Phase)**
**What to include:**
- **Snake Robots** (like Carnegie Mellon University)
  - ✅ Can wiggle into caves
  - ❌ Only used for inspection (cameras)
  - ❌ Not strong enough to dig
- **Vine Robots** (Soft Robotics)
  - ✅ Can squeeze through tiny cracks
  - ❌ Made of soft plastic
  - ❌ Can't move heavy dirt
- **The Gap:** Nothing exists that is both flexible AND strong enough to excavate

**Visuals to add:**
- Simple diagrams of each robot type
- Comparison chart showing limitations

**What to say:** "We researched existing technology. Snake robots can look but can't dig. Vine robots are too soft. Archaeologists need something in the middle - flexible like a snake, but strong enough to excavate."

---

#### **Slide 4: Our Solution - Flexi-Digger (DESIGN & CREATE Phase)**
**What to include:**
- **Core Concept:** Cable-Driven Articulated Arm
- **Key Features:**
  1. **Vertebrae Design:** Made of segments (like a backbone) - can bend into S-shapes
  2. **Cable-Driven:** Heavy motors stay outside the cave - only lightweight arm goes inside
  3. **Soft Excavation:** Uses "Granular Fluidization" - air jet loosens dirt, vacuum removes it gently

**Visuals to add:**
- Diagram of your design
- Photo of your LEGO model
- Arrows showing how cables work

**What to say:** "The Flexi-Digger is a cable-driven articulated arm. Unlike a stiff bulldozer, it's made of vertebrae that allow it to bend around corners. The motors stay outside for safety, and we use a gentle air jet to uncover artifacts without scratching them."

---

#### **Slide 5: How It Works - The Technology (DESIGN & CREATE Phase)**
**What to include:**
- **The Tension Spine Mechanism:**
  - Flexible tubing as the spine
  - Technic beams as vertebrae
  - String "tendons" that pull to curl the arm
- **Granular Fluidization Explained:**
  - Air jet loosens dirt (makes it act like liquid)
  - Vacuum removes dirt gently
  - Reveals artifacts without damage

**Visuals to add:**
- Close-up photos of your LEGO model
- Diagram showing the mechanism
- Before/after of artifact excavation

**What to say:** "Our LEGO prototype demonstrates the Tension Spine. When we pull the string tendon, the arm curls like a finger. Instead of a hard shovel, we use a gentle air jet to loosen dirt, then vacuum it away - like uncovering a treasure without breaking it."

---

#### **Slide 6: Iteration - Learning from Failure (ITERATE Phase)**
**What to include:**
- **First Prototype Problems:**
  - Arm was too floppy
  - Buckled sideways when we tried to curl it
- **How We Fixed It:**
  - Added spacers between vertebrae
  - Increased tension for precise control
- **What We Learned:**
  - Failure is part of the process
  - Testing leads to improvement

**Visuals to add:**
- Photo of the "broken" first version
- Photo of the improved version
- Side-by-side comparison

**What to say:** "Our first version didn't work perfectly. The arm was too floppy and buckled sideways. We iterated by adding spacers between the vertebrae. Now it curls precisely where we want it to. This taught us that failure is how we learn!"

---

#### **Slide 7: Sharing & Feedback (ITERATE Phase)**
**What to include:**
- **Who We Shared With:**
  - Coaches
  - Teachers
  - Parents
  - Community members
- **Feedback We Received:**
  - "Air pressure might be too high" → Added pressure regulator concept
  - "Could be useful beyond archaeology" → Expanded to Search & Rescue
- **How We Used Feedback:**
  - Improved our design documentation
  - Expanded our impact statement

**Visuals to add:**
- Photos of your team sharing with others
- List of feedback points
- "Before/After" showing improvements

**What to say:** "We shared our design with [name specific person]. They suggested we add a pressure regulator to protect fragile artifacts. Based on their feedback, we improved our design. We also learned it could help in Search & Rescue after earthquakes!"

---

#### **Slide 8: Impact - Beyond Archaeology (COMMUNICATE Phase)**
**What to include:**
- **Primary Use:** Archaeological excavation in dangerous spaces
- **Other Applications:**
  - Search & Rescue in collapsed buildings
  - Industrial inspection in tight spaces
  - Mining safety
  - Preserving history while protecting people

**Visuals to add:**
- Icons or images for each application
- Impact statement

**What to say:** "The Flexi-Digger isn't just for archaeologists. It could help rescue people trapped in collapsed buildings after earthquakes, inspect industrial equipment in tight spaces, and make mining safer. It creates a balance between protecting people and preserving history."

---

#### **Slide 9: Our LEGO Model (DESIGN & CREATE Demonstration)**
**What to include:**
- Multiple photos of your model from different angles
- Close-ups of key mechanisms
- The model in action (curled, straight, etc.)

**Visuals to add:**
- High-quality photos
- Labels pointing to key parts (spine, vertebrae, tendons)

**What to say:** "Here's our LEGO prototype. [Demonstrate live] Watch as we pull the string tendon - the arm curls! This proves our concept works. The flexible spine allows it to bend around corners, just like we designed."

---

#### **Slide 10: Conclusion**
**What to include:**
- **Summary Statement:** "With Flexi-Digger, we don't just dig the past - we protect it for the future."
- **Key Points:**
  - Solves a real problem
  - Uses innovative technology
  - Protects both people and artifacts
  - Has applications beyond archaeology
- **Thank You:** "Thank you! We're ready for your questions."

**Visuals to add:**
- Team photo
- Your tagline in large, bold text

**What to say:** "To summarize: Traditional digging is dangerous for humans and bad for history. The Flexi-Digger solves this with a cable-driven, articulated arm that keeps operators safe and uses air to gently uncover treasures. With Flexi-Digger, we don't just dig the past - we protect it for the future. Thank you!"

### Handling Judge Questions

**Common Questions & How to Answer:**

**Q: "How did you come up with this idea?"**
- A: "We identified the problem archaeologists face in tight spaces, researched existing robots that either couldn't bend or couldn't dig, then designed our cable-driven vertebrae solution."

**Q: "What was your biggest challenge?"**
- A: "Making the arm flexible but strong enough to work. Our first prototype was too floppy. We solved it by adding spacers between the vertebrae to create better tension."

**Q: "How does this work in the real world?"**
- A: "The cable-driven design keeps heavy motors outside dangerous spaces. The flexible arm can bend around corners, and the granular fluidization system gently uncovers artifacts without damage."

**Q: "Who did you share this with?"**
- A: "We shared it with [name specific person], who suggested we add a pressure regulator. We also showed it to [another person], who thought it could be useful for Search & Rescue."

**Remember:** Always use the formula: **Problem → Test → Feedback → Change → Improvement**
