## Meeting Summary

The Excavators team had the opportunity to present their innovation project, **Flexi-Digger**, to Dr. Neha Gupta, Assistant Professor of Anthropology at the University of British Columbia, Okanagan. The team discussed their innovative solution for excavating artifacts in tight, dangerous spaces where traditional tools cannot reach.

---

## Presentation Overview

The team presented:
- The problem: Excavating fragile artifacts in dangerous caves and narrow tunnels
- Their research: Existing solutions (Snake Robots, Vine Robots) and their limitations
- Their innovation: The Flexi-Digger - a cable-driven articulated arm with vertebrae design
- Their prototype: LEGO model demonstrating the Tension Spine mechanism
- The solution's impact: Beyond archaeology, including Search & Rescue applications

## Expert Feedback

### Strengths Identified

1. **Real-World Problem Recognition**
   - The expert confirmed that tight-space excavation is a genuine challenge in archaeology
   - Validated that the problem of accessing narrow tunnels and caves is a real concern for field archaeologists
   - Appreciated the team's understanding of safety risks (rockfalls, toxic dust, lack of oxygen)

2. **Innovative Approach**
   - The cable-driven design keeping motors outside dangerous spaces was noted as a practical safety feature
   - The vertebrae-based flexible design addresses a real limitation of current rigid excavation tools
   - The granular fluidization concept for gentle artifact uncovering shows creative problem-solving

3. **Research Quality**
   - The team's research into existing snake robots and vine robots demonstrated good understanding of current technology
   - The identification of gaps in existing solutions (inspection vs. excavation capability) showed critical thinking

### Suggestions for Improvement

1. **Technical Considerations**
   - **Feedback:** Consider the weight and power requirements for the cable-driven system in real-world applications
   - **Action:** Team should research cable tension requirements and motor specifications for different excavation depths
   - **Impact:** This will make the design more realistic and demonstrate deeper engineering understanding

2. **Archaeological Context**
   - **Feedback:** Different soil types (sand, clay, rock) require different excavation approaches
   - **Action:** Consider how the granular fluidization system would work in various soil conditions
   - **Impact:** Shows understanding that archaeological sites vary significantly

3. **Artifact Preservation**
   - **Feedback:** The air pressure and vacuum system needs careful calibration to avoid damaging fragile artifacts
   - **Action:** Research pressure thresholds for different artifact types (pottery, bone, metal)
   - **Impact:** Demonstrates consideration for the primary goal: preserving history

4. **Field Testing Considerations**
   - **Feedback:** Real archaeological sites have uneven terrain and variable conditions
   - **Action:** Consider how the system would be deployed and stabilized in field conditions
   - **Impact:** Shows practical thinking about real-world implementation

### Additional Insights

1. **Real-World Applications**
   - The expert noted that similar flexible robotic systems are being explored in rescue operations
   - Suggested that the team could connect with search and rescue organizations for additional feedback
   - Validated that the application beyond archaeology is a strong point

2. **Archaeological Ethics**
   - Discussed the importance of non-invasive techniques in archaeology
   - The expert appreciated that the Flexi-Digger aims to minimize damage to both artifacts and sites
   - Suggested emphasizing the ethical aspect of preserving cultural heritage

3. **Collaboration Opportunities**
   - The expert mentioned that UBC Okanagan has ongoing archaeology projects that could benefit from such technology
   - Suggested that the team could potentially connect with field archaeologists for future testing opportunities
