# FIRST LEGO League Challenge
## Innovation Project & Core Values – Complete Presentation & Q&A Guide

**Project:** Flexi-Digger

This guide helps your team prepare for judging at the highest level by aligning your presentation, answers, and demonstrations with the official Innovation Project and Core Values rubrics.

## What Judges Are Looking For

**Judges are not looking for perfection.**

They are looking for:
- Clear thinking
- Evidence of learning
- Iteration based on feedback
- Strong teamwork and inclusion

---

## PART 1: INNOVATION PROJECT
### (The What and How of Your Solution)

The Innovation Project rubric evaluates five areas:
1. **Identify**
2. **Design**
3. **Create**
4. **Iterate**
5. **Communicate**

Each section below includes:
- What judges are listening for
- Sample EXCEEDS-level answers
- Demonstration tips

---

### 1. IDENTIFY — Problem & Research

#### Judging Focus
- Is the problem specific and real?
- Who does it affect?
- Is it backed by research?

#### Practice Question
What is the specific problem you are solving, and who does it affect?

#### EXCEEDS-Level Answer (Template)

> We are solving the problem of excavating fragile artifacts in dangerous caves and narrow tunnels where rigid machines cannot fit and it is unsafe for humans to enter. This affects archaeologists who face risks such as rockfalls and toxic dust, and it also affects historical artifacts that are often crushed by traditional heavy excavation tools.

#### Key Talking Points
- Narrow, winding tunnels
- Unstable ceilings
- Human safety risks
- Artifact preservation

---

### 2. CREATE — Solution & Innovation

#### Judging Focus
- What did you build or design?
- How is it different from existing solutions?

#### Practice Question
What is your solution, and how is it different from existing technology?

#### EXCEEDS-Level Answer

> Our innovation is the Flexi-Digger, a cable-driven articulated excavation arm that uses a vertebrae-based design to slither around corners. Unlike Snake Robots, which are mainly used for inspection, or Vine Robots, which are too soft to move soil, our design is flexible and strong enough to excavate safely.

#### Research Comparison (Say This Clearly)
- **Snake Robots** → flexible, but only inspect
- **Vine Robots** → soft, but cannot excavate
- **Flexi-Digger** → flexible and functional

---

### 3. CREATE — LEGO Model Mechanics

#### Practice Question
Can you explain the mechanics of your LEGO model?

#### EXCEEDS-Level Answer

> Our LEGO prototype demonstrates a Tension Spine mechanism. We used flexible LEGO pneumatic tubing as the spine and Technic beams as vertebrae. A string tendon runs through the vertebrae and connects to a motor. When the motor pulls the string, the arm curls like a finger, demonstrating controlled flexibility.

#### Live Demonstration Tip
- Bend the model into an S-shape
- Activate the motor or crank during explanation
- Point to:
  - Spine
  - Vertebrae
  - Tendons

---

### 4. ITERATE — Testing & Improvement

#### Judging Focus
- Did you test?
- Did something fail?
- Did feedback lead to improvement?

#### Practice Question
How did you improve your design after testing and feedback?

#### EXCEEDS-Level Answer

> In our first prototype, the arm was too floppy and buckled sideways. After testing, we added spacers between the vertebrae to increase tension, which allowed the arm to curl precisely. We also received feedback that our air jet could be too strong, so we added a pressure regulator concept to protect fragile artifacts.

#### Judges LOVE Hearing:
- "Our first version failed…"
- "We changed it by…"
- "This made it better because…"

---

### 5. ITERATE — Professional Feedback

#### Why This Matters
Professional feedback proves real-world relevance.

#### Examples to Share

**Feedback #1 — Safety**
- **Who:** Science teacher / civil engineer
- **Feedback:** Air pressure could damage artifacts
- **Change:** Added pressure regulator concept

**Feedback #2 — Stability**
- **Who:** Internal testing / mentor
- **Feedback:** Arm buckled sideways
- **Change:** Added vertebrae spacers

**Feedback #3 — Impact**
- **Who:** Community member
- **Feedback:** Could be useful beyond archaeology
- **Change:** Expanded impact to Search & Rescue

---

### Explaining "Granular Fluidization" Simply

#### Simple Judge-Friendly Explanation

Instead of using a hard shovel, we use a gentle air jet to loosen dirt so it behaves like a liquid. Then a soft vacuum removes the dirt, revealing artifacts without scratching or crushing them.

#### Analogy Shows Understanding
- **Traditional tools** = bull in a china shop
- **Flexi-Digger** = gentle uncovering

---

## PART 2: CORE VALUES
### (The Teamwork and Spirit Judges Observe Everywhere)

Core Values are scored throughout the entire session, not in one section.

---

### Showing Teamwork & Inclusion

#### Practice Question
How did you make sure everyone's ideas were heard?

#### EXCEEDS-Level Answer

> We rotated roles throughout the season and encouraged quieter teammates to share ideas during brainstorming. Tasks like engineering, research, and scripting were divided fairly, and we supported each other during technical challenges.

#### How to SHOW It (Not Just Say It)
- Everyone speaks during judging
- Each member explains one part
- Unified team conclusion

---

### Discovery — What You Learned

#### Examples to Share
- Archaeology excavation challenges
- Granular fluidization
- Soft robotics
- Flexible LEGO structures
- Iteration through failure

---

### Impact — Beyond Archaeology

#### Key Impact Areas
- Preserving history
- Protecting human safety
- Search & Rescue after earthquakes
- Industrial inspection & mining safety

#### Strong Impact Statement

> Flexi-Digger creates a balance between protecting people and preserving history.

---

### Fun — Judges Want to See Joy

#### Creative Ways to Show Fun
- Skit-style introduction
- Props (fake artifacts, danger signs)
- Voice dynamics
- Live model movement
- Celebrating small wins

---

### Team Roles for Presentation (Example)

Assign clear identities, even if roles rotated during the season.

1. **The Archaeologist** — Problem Expert
   - Pain points
   - Human risks
   - Why rigid tools fail

2. **The Engineer** — Technical Lead
   - Tension Spine
   - Vertebrae & tendons
   - Cable-driven safety

3. **The Safety Officer** — Risk & Iteration
   - Human danger
   - Pressure regulation
   - Feedback-based changes

4. **Research & Innovation Lead**
   - Existing robots
   - Why Flexi-Digger is different
   - Granular fluidization

---

### Handling Judge Q&A Confidently

#### Expect Questions About:
- Why your design failed initially
- How your LEGO model represents real technology
- How feedback changed your solution
- Whether your idea works in the real world

#### Always Answer Using This Formula:
**Problem → Test → Feedback → Change → Improvement**

---

### Final Team Conclusion (Say Together)

> "With Flexi-Digger, we don't just dig the past — we protect it for the future."
