# Introduction to FIRST® LEGO® League (2025-2026)

## What is FIRST?

FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) is a global non-profit organization dedicated to preparing young people for the future. Its mission is to inspire students to be leaders and innovators in science and technology by engaging them in exciting, mentor-based programs that build science, engineering, and technology skills.

Beyond robotics, FIRST emphasizes life skills such as self-confidence, communication, and leadership. At the heart of the program are the Core Values:

- **Discovery:** We explore new skills and ideas.
- **Innovation:** We use creativity and persistence to solve problems.
- **Impact:** We apply what we learn to improve our world.
- **Inclusion:** We respect each other and embrace our differences.
- **Teamwork:** We are stronger when we work together.
- **Fun:** We enjoy and celebrate what we do!

## The 2025-2026 Season Theme: UNEARTHED℠

This year, the season theme is UNEARTHED. In the UNEARTHED season, teams will explore the world of archaeology. Students will step into the shoes of archaeologists to uncover the past, analyze their findings, and discover how ancient history can help us build a better future.

## We offer two age-appropriate programs for your children:

### 1. FIRST LEGO League Explore

**Target Age:** 6–10 years old (Grades 2–4)

#### Overview

FLL Explore is a non-competitive, hands-on program designed to capture a child's natural curiosity. It focuses on the fundamentals of engineering and coding while exploring real-world problems.

#### What they will do:

- **Build:** Teams collaborate to design and build a Team Model based on the UNEARTHED theme, using LEGO® bricks and the LEGO® Education SPIKE™ Essential robot to add movement and motion.
- **Explore:** They research the season theme (archaeology) to learn how we uncover and understand the past.
- **Share:** Teams create a Team Poster to document their journey and present their model and ideas to reviewers at a celebratory festival.

### 2. FIRST LEGO League Challenge

**Target Age:** 9–16 years old (Grades 4–8)

#### Overview

FLL Challenge introduces friendly competition. Teams engage in research, problem-solving, coding, and engineering. It is more intensive than Explore and requires students to work together to solve complex tasks.

#### What they will do:

- **Robot Game:** Teams design, build, and program an autonomous robot (using LEGO® SPIKE™ Prime or Mindstorms) to complete specific missions on the UNEARTHED playing field.
- **Innovation Project:** Teams must identify a real-world problem faced by archaeologists and propose a creative new solution (or improve an existing one).
- **Core Values:** Teams are judged on how well they work together and respect each other throughout the season.
