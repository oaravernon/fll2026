# FLL Challenge Innovation Project - UNEARTHED

## Session 1

### Introduction to FLL Challenge – Unearthed

#### What is Unearthed?

This year's theme focuses on archaeology – the science of uncovering the stories of people, cultures, and communities through artifacts, ruins, and underground sites. Archaeology helps us understand how humans interacted with the planet and with each other throughout history.

During this archaeology-inspired season, FIRST teams will use STEM skills, creativity, and teamwork to unearth new findings about ourselves and our communities—and to imagine how these discoveries can help build a better world.

### Aspect Comparison: Archaeology 🏺 vs Paleontology 🦖

| Aspect | Archaeology 🏺 | Paleontology 🦖 |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Focus** | Human history & culture | Prehistoric life (plants & animals) |
| **What they study** | Artifacts (tools, pottery, jewelry, buildings, tombs) | Fossils (bones, teeth, plants, shells) |
| **Goal** | Understand how humans lived, built, and interacted | Understand how life on Earth evolved and went extinct |
| **Time Period** | Past human history (thousands of years) | Prehistoric times, millions of years ago (before humans) |
| **Methods** | Excavations of cities, temples, graves, artifacts | Fossil digs, rock layers, carbon dating |
| **Examples** | Ancient Egyptian pyramids, Mayan temples, Stone Age tools | Dinosaur skeletons, woolly mammoth fossils, fossilized plants |

**Easy Memory Trick:**
- **Archaeology** = People's Past
- **Paleontology** = Dino/Fossil Past

## Archaeology & Technology

Archaeology is no longer just digging with shovels. Today, archaeologists use a mix of traditional and modern technologies:

- **Traditional methods:** digging, excavation grids, ground-penetrating radar, sonar.
- **Modern methods:** muon tomography, satellite imaging, drones, and AI to "see" underground without digging.

---

### What Are Muons?

- Muons are tiny, invisible particles that come from space (cosmic rays).
- They are like super-fast messengers that pass through air, mountains, and even the ground.
- Unlike light or X-rays, muons can travel deep into rock and soil.

### How Muons Help Archaeologists

- Scientists use muon detectors to capture and measure how muons travel through underground material.
- As muons pass through, some get absorbed or slowed down depending on what lies beneath.
- By measuring these patterns, scientists can build an "X-ray" map of the earth.

### Real-World Examples

- Discovered hidden chambers in the Great Pyramid of Giza (2017).
- Monitored volcanoes safely by mapping lava chambers.
- Detected underground caves, tunnels, and ancient cities.

✅ **Takeaway for Students:** This season is about digging deeper—not just into the ground, but into ideas, teamwork, and creativity. Archaeology + technology shows us how science helps uncover hidden worlds, and your FLL journey will do the same!

## STEM Topics

### Particle Accelerator

#### What is a Particle Accelerator?

A particle accelerator is like a giant super-fast racetrack for tiny particles.

- The "racers" are particles (like protons or electrons), which are way too small to see.
- The accelerator uses electric fields and magnets to push these particles faster and faster—almost to the speed of light.
- When the particles are going super fast, scientists make them crash into each other or into a target.

#### Why Crash Them?

- When particles crash, they break apart into even smaller pieces, kind of like smashing LEGO bricks to see what they're made of.
- This helps scientists understand the building blocks of the universe.
- It can also help make new discoveries—like finding new particles (e.g., the Higgs boson in 2012).
- Smaller accelerators are also used in medicine (like cancer treatments) and technology.

---

### Medicine: Particle Accelerators in Cancer Treatment

- **Radiation therapy:** Small accelerators called linear accelerators (LINACs) create high-energy X-rays or electrons. Doctors aim these beams at tumors to kill cancer cells without needing surgery.
- **Proton therapy:** Special accelerators speed up protons instead of X-rays. Protons stop at a very precise spot inside the body, so doctors can destroy a tumor without damaging healthy tissue behind it.

**Fun fact:** More than 30,000 accelerators worldwide are used in hospitals!

---

### Technology & Industry

- **Making materials stronger:** Accelerators can shoot particles into metals or semiconductors, changing their properties. This helps make stronger airplane parts or better computer chips.
- **Sterilizing medical equipment:** Accelerators create beams that kill germs on syringes, bandages, or food packaging—without using heat or chemicals.
- **Imaging & scanning:** Some accelerators are used to create intense X-rays for studying the structure of proteins, viruses, or new medicines at the atomic level.

---

### Particle Accelerators & Computer Chips

#### What's inside a chip?

A computer chip (or microchip) is like the "brain" of your phone, tablet, or laptop.

- It's made of tiny circuits built on silicon (a material from sand).
- These circuits are unbelievably small—billions of transistors fit on a chip the size of your fingernail!

#### How accelerators help make chips

- To make chips work, scientists need to change the properties of silicon.
- Particle accelerators can fire ions (charged atoms) into the silicon.
- This process is called ion implantation.
- By carefully placing these ions, the silicon can be turned into different "zones" that let electricity flow in just the right way.
- Without this, the chip wouldn't know how to switch on/off or process information.

#### Why not just use normal tools?

- The features on chips are so tiny—measured in nanometers (nm), way smaller than a red blood cell—that only high-energy particle beams from accelerators can do this job accurately.
- Accelerators allow pinpoint precision, so chips can become faster, smaller, and more powerful.

#### Everyday Impact

Your smartphone, laptop, game console, or even a smartwatch has chips shaped by accelerators. Every swipe, tap, and video stream relies on accelerators that helped build the chip inside!

## Subatomic Particles

### 1. Quarks – The Building Blocks of Matter

- Quarks are like the LEGO bricks of the universe.
- They combine to form protons and neutrons, which are inside every atom's nucleus.
- There are 6 types (flavors) of quarks: Up, Down, Charm, Strange, Top, Bottom.
- **Protons** = 2 up + 1 down quark.
- **Neutrons** = 2 down + 1 up quark.

### 2. Leptons – The Lightweight Family

- Leptons don't need quarks; they exist on their own.
- The most famous lepton is the **electron** ⚡—the tiny particle that orbits the nucleus and carries electricity.
- There are 6 leptons in total:
  - Electron, Muon, Tau, and their 3 neutrinos (electron neutrino, muon neutrino, tau neutrino).
- Neutrinos are super hard to detect—they pass through your body all the time without you noticing!

### 3. Bosons – The Force Carriers

If quarks and leptons are "players," then bosons are the referees. They carry the fundamental forces of nature.

**Examples:**
- **Photon** – carries light and electromagnetism.
- **Gluon** – "glues" quarks together inside protons and neutrons.
- **W and Z bosons** – responsible for radioactive decay.
- **Graviton** (theoretical) – would carry gravity if confirmed.
- **Higgs boson** – discovered in 2012, it gives particles their mass.

### Putting It Together

- **Quarks + Leptons** = Matter (they make up all stuff).
- **Bosons** = Forces (they make particles interact).

Together, they form what scientists call the **Standard Model of Particle Physics**—like the rulebook for how the universe works at the smallest scale.

**Takeaway for kids:**
- Quarks build things.
- Leptons move around on their own (like electrons).
- Bosons make sure everything interacts and sticks together.

- **Innovation:** Combine mobile apps + sensors to save time.
- **Impact:** Make archaeological records more accurate.
- **Inclusion:** Every team member contributes — coding, data entry, presentation.
- **Fun:** Turn artifact scanning into a relay race.

---

### Imaging

**Problem:** Some artifacts are too fragile to move. Researchers need high-quality digital images on site.

#### Innovation Directions:

- Portable 3D scanner (LiDAR, structured light, photogrammetry).
- Robot scanner on wheels that can move around the object.
- Drone scanner for big structures.

#### Prototype Tips:

## Session 3

### Improve Excavation Grids

**Problem:** Archaeologists must record exactly where every artifact was found. A wrong grid loses context.

#### Innovation Directions

- Laser grid system projected on excavation ground.
- AR goggles showing excavation squares.
- GPS tagging system that records coordinates instantly.

---

### Using Drones

**Laser grid system projected on excavation ground.**

This is probably not a good idea

---

### Using Augmented Reality

**AR goggles showing excavation squares.**

This is probably a good idea to explore

---

### Excavation Grids — Problems to Solve

- **Uneven terrain:** slopes/rocks distort squares; strings/markers stretch.
- **Environment:** wind/rain/dust remove markers; sunlight reduces visibility.
- **Human error:** tape/stake mis-measurements shift the entire grid.
- **Poor visibility during digs:** strings get buried/cut; reference points lost.
- **Scaling:** large sites take long to grid; small errors multiply.
- **Drift over time:** soil/weather/foot traffic move markers; re-alignment needed.
- **Record-keeping:** manual notes lead to errors; later digitizing is hard.

---

### Directions (Pros & Cons)

#### Drones

**Pros:** fast coverage; handles uneven terrain; easy re-checks; great for documentation.

**Cons:** weather & battery limits; skilled piloting; weak in caves/indoors.

#### Laser Grid Projection

**Pros:** instant, clear lines; no physical strings; quick setup; precise if calibrated.

**Cons:** hard to see in bright sun; needs power; occlusion by people/objects; dust fragility.

#### AR Goggles

**Pros:** personal, precise overlay; works when markers vanish; supports 3D (walls/trenches); links to GPS/data.

**Cons:** expensive/heavy; power/calibration; software/GPS reliability; training needed.

**Summary:** Use drones for mapping big areas, lasers for active trench layout, AR for per-person precision + digital recording. A combo is the strongest.

---

### Why AR if We Have Lasers?

- **Lasers** = shared "ruler on the ground"; great on flat surfaces; can be blocked/washed out; 2D only.
- **AR** = personal "digital ruler + notebook"; works in 3D, persists even if lines/markers disappear, ties to artifact metadata.

---

## Session 5

### Detailed Study Notes

**Topic:** Laser Projection and Pico Projector Research

**Team Project:** Digital Excavation Grid for Archaeology (FLL Innovation Project 2026 – Unearthed)

**OARA is pronounced "ohra"**

The classes is organized and conducted by OARA Youth Innovation Lab, Vernon, BC

---

### 1. Background: Laser Grid Projection – Challenges in Scaling

During our early design experiments, we tried to model a laser-based excavation grid system using beam splitters and line lasers in 3D (Tinkercad).

The idea was to project straight laser lines to form excavation squares, replacing manual string grids used in real archaeology.

#### Findings

- Each beam splitter can only divide one laser beam into two beams.
- To form a full grid (with multiple parallel lines in both X and Y directions), we would need many beam splitters and laser mounts.
- The system quickly became inefficient, complex to align, and difficult to scale.

#### Conclusion

While small-scale grids can be achieved with two lasers and a few splitters, scaling to full excavation sites would be mechanically cumbersome.

Therefore, we began exploring optical and digital alternatives, such as Diffractive Optical Elements (DOE) and pico projectors.

---

### 2. Further Research Topics

#### (A) Diffractive Optical Elements (DOE)

- A DOE can split or shape a beam into multiple patterns (lines, dots, grids).
- It's a passive optical element — etched or molded glass/plastic that diffracts light into many controlled directions.
- **Advantage:** A single DOE can replace many beam splitters.
- **Limitation:** Hard to fabricate and requires specific wavelength matching.

Because DOE-based setups still involve laser safety concerns, we looked for a safer, more scalable projection method — leading us to the pico projector.

---

### 3. Pico Projector: Overview

#### Definition

A pico projector is a miniaturized, portable projector capable of displaying images, grids, or videos on walls, sand surfaces, or any flat area.

"Pico" refers to its tiny size—often small enough to fit in your pocket or be embedded into another device (e.g., a smartphone).

#### Core Concept

Pico projectors shrink the functionality of a traditional projector into a compact device by using low-power light sources and miniaturized optics.

---

### Core Components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Light Source** | Typically uses LEDs or laser diodes — efficient, compact, and long-lasting. |
| **Display Chip** | Generates the image using one of three main technologies:<br>– **DLP (Digital Light Processing)** Tiny mirrors reflect light to form pixels.<br>– **LCoS (Liquid Crystal on Silicon)** Combines LCD and silicon mirrors.<br>– **LBS (Laser Beam Steering)** Uses moving mirrors to scan a laser beam pixel by pixel. |
| **Optics** | Lenses and mirrors focus and direct the image onto the surface. |
| **Electronics + Battery** | Power management, image processing, and connectivity (HDMI, USB, Wi-Fi). |

---

### 4. Advantages and Limitations

#### Advantages

- **Portability:** Lightweight and fits in a pocket or small tripod mount.
- **Ease of setup:** No optical alignment required; ready-to-use.
- **Connectivity:** Supports HDMI, USB, or wireless (Wi-Fi / Bluetooth) input from smartphones or laptops.
- **Multi-purpose:** Can display grids, presentations, or educational videos.

#### Limitations

- **Brightness:** Works best in dim or shaded environments.
- **Resolution:** Lower than full-sized projectors (usually 720p).
- **Image Size:** Limited projection range; large images lose sharpness.
- **Battery life:** Typically 1–2 hours on internal battery.

---

### 5. Applications Beyond Archaeology

| Field | Example Use |
|-------|-------------|
| **Education** | Interactive classroom projections, portable STEM displays. |
| **Business** | Quick presentations, product demos, mobile sales kits. |
| **Healthcare** | Bedside imaging or visual aids for patient education. |
| **Retail** | Dynamic in-store displays or digital signage. |
| **Gaming** | Portable, immersive mini gaming setups. |

---

### 6. DOE Integration in Pico Projectors

#### When Pico Projectors Use a DOE

- Laser-based LBS projectors often integrate a DOE for beam shaping and speckle reduction.
- The DOE diffuses or structures the light to improve uniformity and reduce flicker.

#### When They Don't

- DLP and LCoS LED projectors do not need DOEs because they create images via micromirrors or liquid crystals, not direct laser scanning.

#### How to Identify

- If the specs mention "Laser Beam Steering" or RGB laser diodes, it likely includes a DOE.
- If the specs list LED light source with DLP or LCoS, it does not use one.

---

### 7. Battery-Powered Pico Projectors — Technology Breakdown

#### (A) DLP (Digital Light Processing)

- Uses thousands of tiny mirrors on a microchip to reflect light.
- A color wheel splits the beam into RGB light.
- Brightness depends on mirror tilt frequency.

**Pros:** Compact, high contrast.

**Cons:** Slight color breakup ("rainbow effect").

#### (B) LCoS (Liquid Crystal on Silicon)

- Uses liquid crystals to modulate reflected light.
- Can achieve smoother color blending with subpixels or sequential color.

**Pros:** Sharp images, good color.

**Cons:** Slightly dimmer, slower refresh.

#### (C) LBS (Laser Beam Steering)

- Uses red, green, and blue lasers combined into one beam.
- Scanning mirror steers beam pixel-by-pixel at ~60 Hz.

**Pros:** Always in focus, even on curved surfaces.

**Cons:** More expensive; potential laser safety concerns; "speckle" patterns.

---

### 8. Why Pico Projectors Are Ideal for Our Project

🔍 **Problem**

Creating visible excavation grids safely and efficiently.

💡 **Solution**

A pico projector can project a digital grid pattern on the excavation site—just like a laser grid, but safer, scalable, and easily modifiable.

#### Benefits

- Eliminates complex optics (no beam splitters or alignment).
- Works instantly with one image file.
- Grid pattern can be resized, recolored, or animated digitally.
- Safe for classrooms (no laser beams).
- Portable and battery-powered for outdoor archaeology demos.

---

### 9. Setting Up a Pico Projector for Excavation Grid Projection

#### Step 1: Create the Grid Image

Design a grid using:

- **Image Editors:** Photoshop, GIMP, or Paint.
- **Presentation Tools:** PowerPoint or Google Slides.
- **Online Generators:** patternprojector.com or similar.

- Use clear, contrasting lines (black or dark green) on a light background.
- Include optional coordinate labels (A1, A2, etc.).

#### Step 2: Get the Right Equipment

| Equipment | Notes |
|-----------|-------|
| **Pico Projector** | Choose LED-based, ≥100 lumens for indoor; ≥200 lumens for outdoor use. |
| **Tripod Mount** | Keeps projection stable and centered. |
| **Power Source** | Built-in battery or external USB power bank. |
| **Display Source** | Smartphone, tablet, or laptop (HDMI or Wi-Fi connection). |

#### Step 3: Calibrate and Project

- Mount projector above center of site on a tripod.
- Adjust angle to minimize distortion.
- Use keystone correction to fix trapezoidal shape.
- Verify square accuracy by comparing projected grid with a physical ruler or object.

#### Step 4: Environmental Adjustments

- Use in dim light or shaded area for best contrast.
- Uneven surfaces will bend grid lines — great opportunity to discuss real-world mapping challenges in archaeology.
