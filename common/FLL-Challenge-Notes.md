## Project Sparks

### Archaeological Process – Step-by-Step Breakdown

#### Step 1: Identify Site

**Scenario:** During an excursion, a team discovers an ancient map suggesting more artifacts nearby.

**Question:** How will the archaeology team identify where additional artifacts are located?

**Analysis & Ideas:**
- Use satellite imagery, drones, or LiDAR to scan the ground for unusual patterns.
- Analyze soil composition and plant growth (some plants grow differently over buried structures).
- Utilize AI models trained on geographic data to predict artifact locations.
- Combine old maps with modern GPS coordinates to pinpoint likely dig sites.

#### Step 2: Survey & Map

**Scenario:** The team wants to explore caves and record changes in the landscape.

**Question:** How can the team use technology to create a modern-day map of the cave and the full site?

**Analysis & Ideas:**
- Employ 3D laser scanning (LiDAR) and photogrammetry to create digital models.
- Use drones to capture aerial images for mapping terrain and site layout.
- Apply ground-penetrating radar (GPR) to detect underground structures.
- Create a digital twin or VR simulation of the site for study and collaboration.

#### Step 3: Excavate

**Scenario:** The team starts finding daily-life artifacts like millstones, coins, and beads.

**Question:** What tools can the team use to get these items out of the ground without damaging or losing any of them?

**Analysis & Ideas:**
- Use soft excavation tools: brushes, small picks, and sieves.
- Introduce robotic excavation arms with precision sensors.
- Apply sonic imaging to locate fragile items before digging.
- Use IoT sensors to monitor vibration and soil pressure while digging.
- Keep a digital catalog (using tablets or AR overlays) to document artifact locations.

#### Step 4: Reconstruct & Restore

**Scenario:** Artifacts near a water source are found in fragments; reassembly is difficult.

**Question:** How can the team improve the restoration process?

**Analysis & Ideas:**
- 3D-scan broken pieces and use AI algorithms to digitally reconstruct the shape.
- Use 3D printing to recreate missing or damaged sections.
- Apply chemical stabilization techniques to preserve artifacts from corrosion.
- Create a virtual restoration model before physical assembly.
- Develop a collaborative software platform where experts can test restoration ideas digitally.

---

#### Step 5: Share & Publish

**Scenario:** A mysterious artifact is found; solving its meaning requires collaboration.

**Question:** How can archaeologists work with teams in other careers to solve the mysteries together?

**Analysis & Ideas:**
- Collaborate with historians, linguists, geologists, and AI researchers.
- Use online databases and digital museums for global data sharing.
- Apply machine learning to compare findings across regions.
- Host virtual conferences or use platforms like Slack/Teams for inter-team collaboration.
- Encourage citizen science participation via mobile apps for tagging and identifying artifacts.
