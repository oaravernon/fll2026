## 1. Introduction & Getting Started

**Slides used:** `fll-explore-unearthed-session-slide-intro.pptx`

### What is FIRST® LEGO® League Explore?

**Simple explanation for kids:**  
“We are a team that learns about a real-world topic (this year: archaeology and digging up the past!). We build with LEGO®, use a tablet to make our builds move, and at the end we share what we learned at a festival.”

**Key ideas to share:**
- We **explore** the challenge (learn about archaeology).
- We **create** a team model (build something that shows what we learned).
- We use the **Engineering Design Process**: Explore → Create → Test → Share.
- At the **festival** we show our model and a poster about our journey.

### Goals for the Season

**Activity:** Have each child write or draw their goals on **page 6** of the Engineering Notebook.

**Sample answers kids might give (you can suggest these if they’re stuck):**
- “I want to learn how to code the LEGO robot.”
- “I want to build something that moves.”
- “I want to work with my team and make new friends.”
- “I want to learn about archaeologists and old things in the ground.”

**How to explain “goals”:**  
“A goal is something you want to get better at or learn by the end of our sessions.”

### Materials

- **UNEARTHED™ Explore Set** (LEGO elements, mat, instructions).
- Each session slide deck lists what you need; use that list before every session.

**Tip:** Watch the **FIRST LEGO League YouTube Channel** — 2025–2026 UNEARTHED Season Playlist — for short videos that support the theme.

## 3. Session 1: Archaeology Adventure

**Slides:** `fll-explore-unearthed-session-slide-1.pptx`

### Learning Goals

- Work with the team using **Discovery** to explore the UNEARTHED theme and share what I know about archaeology.
- Build things related to archaeology.

### Key Vocabulary (with kid-friendly definitions)

| Word | Definition for kids |
|------|---------------------|
| **Archaeology** | The study of how people (or animals) lived in the past. |
| **Artifact** | Something from the past that people made or used (e.g. a pot, a tool). |
| **Excavate** | To dig carefully to uncover something that was buried. |

### Guiding Questions & Sample Answers

**“What do you know about archaeology?”**  
- Sample: “Archaeology is when people dig in the ground to find old things like pots, bones, or tools.”  
- Sample: “Archaeologists try to understand how people lived a long time ago.”

**“What does an archaeologist do?”**  
- Sample: “They dig carefully, draw and take pictures of what they find, and study artifacts in a lab.”

**“What do you think is happening in the Explore Story?”**  
- Use **page 4** of the Engineering Notebook. Sample: “People are exploring a place and finding old things. Maybe they are looking for clues about the past.”

**“What do you see on the mat?”**  
- Sample: “We see a mat with pictures or places where archaeologists might dig.”

**“How do archaeologists know where to dig?”**  
- Sample: “They look at old maps, use tools like radar, or look for clues on the ground.”

**“What do archaeologists look for?”**  
- Sample: “Artifacts like tools, pottery, bones, and old buildings.”

### Activity 1

- Get into groups and pick a **team name**. Write it on **page 3** of the Engineering Notebook.
- Look at the **Explore Story** on **page 4**. Ask: What do you see? What are the characters doing?
- Share what you know about archaeology and write or draw it on **page 8**.

### Activity 2: Artifact Challenge

- Split into two groups. Each group builds a **small artifact** with LEGO pieces.
- Draw the artifact on **page 9**.
- **Challenge:** Take the artifact apart, trade pieces and drawing with the other group, and try to **rebuild the other group’s artifact** using only their drawing.

**Why this matters:** It shows that archaeologists have to describe and draw what they find so others can understand it—just like we use a drawing to rebuild.

### Career Connection: Archaeologist

- “Archaeologists are storytellers of the past. They do research, excavate (dig up) treasures, work in a lab, or take care of old collections.”

## 4. Session 2: Relic Rescue

**Slides:** `fll-explore-unearthed-session-slide-2.pptx`

### Learning Goals

- Build the **radar** and **excavation site** models from the Explore Set.
- Talk with the team about artifacts and tools used to find them.

### Key Vocabulary

| Word | Definition for kids |
|------|---------------------|
| **Radar** | A device that can “see” or detect things (e.g. under the ground) without digging first. |
| **Archaeological Process** | The steps archaeologists use: find a site, survey and map it, dig carefully, then share what they find. |
| **Dig Site** | A place where archaeologists dig to find artifacts and learn about the past. |
| **Relic** | Something left from a long time ago (like an old object). |

### The Archaeological Process (from slides)

1. **Identify Site** — Decide where to dig.  
2. **Survey & Map** — Measure and draw the area.  
3. **Excavate** — Dig carefully layer by layer.  
4. **Rebuild** — Put things back or record where everything was.

- Sample: “Shovels, trowels, brushes, radar, cameras, and screens to sift dirt.”

**“How can radar help an archaeologist find an artifact?”**  
- Sample: “Radar sends signals into the ground. When something is there, the signal bounces back so we know where to dig.”

**“How do archaeologists know where to dig?”**  
- Sample: “They use radar, old maps, or look for bumps or different colored soil.”

**“What kinds of artifacts could be detected by radar?”**  
- Sample: “Walls, old rooms, metal objects, or big things buried under the ground.”

**“What artifacts can be found inside the [excavation] model?”**  
- Sample: “Small LEGO artifacts like pots or tools—like real artifacts in a dig site.”

**“How do you think these artifacts were used?”**  
- Sample: “Pots for holding food or water; tools for cutting or digging.”

**“How many artifacts are inside the excavation model?”**  
- Count with the kids during the activity; answer depends on the set.

**“How do archaeologists keep track of what they find?”**  
- Sample: “They take photos, draw maps, put labels on bags, and write in notebooks.”

**“How do you put the model back together after another team member took it apart?”**  
- Sample: “We follow the building instructions and work as a team—Builder and Element Finder help.”

### Activities

- **Activity 1:** Build the **radar** (Bags 1, Book 1). Put it on the mat and take turns moving it. Discuss what could be “detected.”
- **Activity 2:** Build the **excavation model** (Bags 2–5, Book 2). Remove layers and put them back. Look at different “rooms” and guess how each was used.
- **Challenge:** Take turns “excavating” the model and taking out one artifact. Share what you learned about artifacts and excavating.
