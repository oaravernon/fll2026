# FLL Explore UNEARTHED™ — 6-Hour Crash Course

**Goal:** Get your team event-ready in one day.  
**Must-have for the festival:** Team name, Core Values, **team model** (with one motorized part), **team poster**, and a short practiced presentation.

Use the full **FLL-Explore-Unearthed-Teaching-Guide.md** for detailed answers and vocabulary.

## What You Must Have at the Event

| Item | Why |
|------|-----|

| **Team model** | Must include: archaeologist, excavation site, tools, one special artifact, **one part motorized with SPIKE**. |
| **Team poster** | Shows your team journey (what you learned, built, and did together). |
| **Core Values** | Judges may ask how you used Discovery, Teamwork, etc. |

| **3** | 1:00–2:30 | Build radar + excavation model (from set) |
| **4** | 2:30–3:30 | Coding: one motor lesson (Carousel) + one sensor (Animal Alarm) |
| **5** | 3:30–5:00 | Design & build **team model** (with motorized part) |
| **6** | 5:00–5:40 | Create **team poster** |
| **7** | 5:40–6:00 | Practice presentation + assign who says what |

## Block 1 — Intro (30 min)

- **Team name** → Write in Engineering Notebook page 3.
- **Goals** → One sentence each on page 6 (e.g. “Learn to code,” “Build something that moves”).
- **Core Values** — Say them once: Discovery, Inclusion, Innovation, Teamwork, Impact, Fun.  
  - One-liner: “We explore, work together, use our imagination, and have fun.”
- **Roles** — Assign for the day: Material Manager, Reporter, Builder, Element Finder, Coder. Rotate if you have time later.

---

## Block 2 — Archaeology + Explore Story (30 min)

- **Three words:** **Archaeology** = studying the past. **Artifact** = old object people used. **Excavate** = dig carefully to find things.
- **Explore Story** (Notebook page 4): “What do you see? What are the characters doing?” → They’re exploring and finding old things.
- **Quick share:** “What do archaeologists do?” → Dig, draw, take photos, study in a lab.
- *Optional (if time):* Build one small “artifact” with LEGO and trade with another group to rebuild from a drawing (Session 1 activity).

---

## Block 3 — Build Radar + Excavation Model (1.5 hr)

- **Radar** — Book 1, Bag 1. Place on mat; say “radar finds things under the ground without digging first.”
- **Excavation model** — Book 2, Bags 2–5. Remove layers and put back; take turns “excavating” one artifact.
- **Archaeological process** (say once): Identify site → Survey & map → Excavate → Rebuild → Share. (Notebook page 30.)
- These builds give you pieces and ideas for your **team model** later.

---

## Block 4 — Coding (1 hr)

- **SPIKE App** → FIRST LEGO League Explore Unit.
- **Classic Carousel** — Motor blocks: start, wait, stop. “We make something spin/move.”
- **Animal Alarm** — Sensor: when it detects (e.g. color), play sound or light. “We detect something and the model reacts.”
- **Must-do:** By end of day, **one part** of your team model must be **motorized** (motor or sensor). Even a simple “start motor for 2 seconds” is enough.

---

## Block 5 — Team Model (1.5 hr)

**Requirements (non-negotiable):**

1. **Archaeologist** (minifig or small build).
2. **Excavation site** (place to “dig” or where artifacts are).
3. **Tools** (e.g. radar, shovel, cart—can use set builds or add-ons).
4. **One special artifact** (something they “found”).
5. **One motorized part** — Use SPIKE Essential: spinning radar, moving cart, turning millstone, or sensor that beeps when it “finds” something.

- **Design first:** Quick sketch on Notebook pages 22–23 with labels.
- **Build together:** Use Explore Set + mat only. Everyone contributes.
- **Code:** One program that runs the motorized part. Test it before you finish.

---

## Block 6 — Team Poster (40 min)

- **Include:** Team name, what you learned about archaeology, your team model (drawing or photo), your journey (explore → build → code → share), Core Values (e.g. “We used teamwork and discovery”).
- **Notebook page 25:** Jot or draw ideas first.
- **Create poster:** Paper or board; everyone adds something (drawing, words, stickers).
- Keep it simple: 4–6 items are enough.

---

## Block 7 — Practice Presentation (20 min)

- **Assign lines:**
  - “We are [team name]. We learned about archaeology and UNEARTHED.”
  - “This is our model. It has an archaeologist, excavation site, tools, and an artifact. This part is motorized—[describe what it does].”
  - “I’ll explain the program: [one sentence].”
  - “Our poster shows our journey and how we used Core Values.”
- **Run through once** with the model on the mat and poster visible.
- **Judge-style question:** “How did you use teamwork?” → “We built and coded together and everyone had a role.”

---

## Event Day Checklist

- [ ] Team name decided and on poster.
- [ ] Team model has all 5 parts (archaeologist, site, tools, artifact, motorized part).
- [ ] Model runs reliably (batteries/charge, program tested).
- [ ] Poster shows journey + Core Values.
- [ ] Everyone knows their one sentence (or two) for the presentation.
- [ ] Engineering Notebook has at least: team name (p.3), goals (p.6), and design/sketch (p.22–23) — optional but good to bring.

## If You’re Short on Time

| Priority | Do this |
|----------|---------|
| **Must** | Team model with motorized part + team poster + who says what. |
| **High** | Radar or excavation build (so they’ve built from instructions). One coding lesson (Carousel or Animal Alarm). |
| **Medium** | Core Values by name + one example. Archaeology in one sentence. |
| **Skip or shorten** | Full Session 1 artifact trade, all three tools in Session 6, every career connection, long notebook pages. |

## One-Page Cheat Sheet (for Coach)

**Theme:** UNEARTHED = archaeology, digging up the past, finding and protecting old things.

**Core Values:** Discovery, Inclusion, Innovation, Teamwork, Impact, Fun — “We explore, include everyone, create, work together, make a difference, and have fun.”

**Model needs:** Archaeologist + excavation site + tools + one artifact + **one part that moves (code)**.

**Poster needs:** Team name, what we learned, our model, our journey, Core Values.

**Sample answer for judges:** “We used **teamwork** by building and coding together. We used **discovery** by learning how radar and sensors help archaeologists.”

Good luck at the festival.
